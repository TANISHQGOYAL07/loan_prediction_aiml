        "The loan prediction AIML project revolves around the task of predicting whether a loan applicant is creditworthy, primarily aiming to assist financial institutions in minimizing default risks and making informed lending decisions. The project involves various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance.\n",

The dataset includes attributes such as Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, and Loan_Status. These attributes provide essential information about loan applicants and their loan approval status.\n",

One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into binary vectors, where each category is represented by a binary value (0 or 1) in a separate column. This method is used because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input data, and one-hot encoding allows us to represent categorical variables in a numerical format without assuming any ordinal relationship between categories. It helps prevent the model from interpreting categorical variables as ordinal when they are not. Additionally, one-hot encoding ensures that each category is treated equally in the model, without assigning any arbitrary numerical values that could introduce bias.\n"
